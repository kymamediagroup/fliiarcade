Ports for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation and Windows were released in 1997. In the game, players control one of ten fighters who have been given great power by a mysterious ore that crashed-landed on Earth from outer space. The object of the game is to defeat all the other fighters to become the most powerful warrior on the planet.\r\n\r\nThe game was heavily influenced by Midway's Mortal Kombat series, and features controls similar to the Mortal Kombat games, as well as the series signature fatalities. Unique to War Gods is the \"3D\" button, allowing users to use the background/foreground for additional attacks and evasive maneuvers. The game's graphics were created using a technology Midway called \"digital skin\", which mapped photographs onto 3D models.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"Midway","year":1995,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Life Like Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
