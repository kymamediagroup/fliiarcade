It was designed and programmed for Exidy by Larry W. Hutcherson Sr. and released in 1982. Touted as the �First Educational Coin-Op Game�, you play a busy carpenter that is constantly being chased by hammers and whirlwinds throughout a grid of scaffolding while manipulating letters to spell �E-X-I-D-Y� or �H-A-R-D-H-A-T�. Controls consist of a simple 4-direction joystick, both players alternating use during a two player game.\r\n\r\nThe hardware is identical to another Exidy game, Pepper II.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Exidy","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"dbcdf353"}
