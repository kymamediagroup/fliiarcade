The player can eat an energizer to turn the ghosts blue, making them vulnerable for a short period of time, and allowing the player to eat them for extra points. Once the maze is cleared, a new maze will be presented and the gameplay will continue.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Bally Midway","year":1983,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
