After take-off from your base you must blast and avoid various alien ships and blocks and if you touch one then you lose one of three lives. After a certain distance travelled the game turns into a single screen as a Goke appears with eight Mitiohro around it's body. The Goke sends out ships called Ahro to try to kill you and you must destroy all eight Mitiohro when they have changed colour for a short time. Once the Goke is destroyed, you can get bonus points for trying to land as near to the center of your base. Two players can play and each player takes it in turn to play when the other player is killed.","genre":"Shooter","manufacturer":"Orca (Esco Trading Co)","year":1983,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
