As in Pac-Man the goal is to collect all of the dots to advance to next level, but in Eyes you shoot the dots rather than eat them. Computer-controlled eyes chase and shoot at the player. Shooting a computer eye gives points and removes it from the level, but it will reappear a short time later. Being shot by a computer eye is fatal.\r\n\r\nAs the game progresses, more computer eyes are added to levels and they take less time to shoot at the player. They also move faster.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Digitrex Techstar (Rock-Ola license)","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
