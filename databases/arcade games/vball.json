The game features funky music and challenging game play. Computer opponent skills grow greater as levels increase or play against a human opponent.\r\n\r\nThis is a beach volleyball game that features two-player competitive play or one-player against the CPU. Good looking graphics and great music. You play one game against successively more skillful players as you progress through cities across the USA. The game play is challenging and your opponents get tough pretty quickly. Each match lasts for only a limited amount of time. You control two players on screen. Once you intercept an incoming shot, the computer takes control of that player allowing you to get the second player in position to slam the ball over the net. You can additionally make diving interceptions. A flashing blue target on the ground shows where the ball will land. As well as muscle-bound beach heroes and cheering crowds, there is a bikini-clad young woman who raises her arms to show who won the point.","genre":"Sports/Volleyball","manufacturer":"Technos Japan","year":1988,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
