Shoot tons of nasty robots that are out to get you. Exit each level to progress to a new maze, with boss levels and the option to buy upgrades between levels.\r\n\r\nThis is possibly one of the first 3-D shooters ever made. While there are none of the full, free motion effects of the traditional modern day 3-D engines, you are able to change perspectives on the fly.\r\nThe names of the characters are Captian Ace Gunn and Major Rock Hardy.\r\n\r\nThis game is like playing a primitive version of Doom, or a futuristic, first-person 3-D Gauntlet game.\r\n\r\nThe game also got ported to many computers back in the day including the MSX, ZX Spectrum, C64, Amiga, and Atari ST just to name a few. Also got a port to Atari's own Lynx handheld in 1991.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Atari Games","year":1987,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
