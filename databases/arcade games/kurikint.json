Players control a Chinese policeman who must dispatch numerous enemies while progressing through the game's levels.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to rescue a senior policeman and his daughter, both of whom have been kidnapped by a gang and spirited away to an underground hideout.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting thing about this game is that it is freely (and not officially) inspired from two popular manga of this period:\r\n\r\nDragon Ball, for the main character aspect and powers (can throw kamehamehas and uses a sort of Kaï¿½o-Ken).\r\n\r\nHokuto No Ken, for bosses aspect and technics they use.\r\n\r\nVideo game adaptations of these two manga were rare in 1988 (apart from NES and Master System), that's why the game was somehow (and is still) popular among a category of players.\r\n\r\nThe game received though a mixed response from games critics.","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Taito Corporation Japan","year":1988,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
