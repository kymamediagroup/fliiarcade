A basic football-ish game is played on a field filled with weapons, traps, and even paid-off bystanders that will do anything to slow you down!\r\n\r\nYou are the captain of a team of barbarians, trying to make as many 'touchdowns' as possible. Not only can you pass or lateral the ball to your teammates, but you can pick up concealed weapons too (then when a defender tries to tackle you, he comes out of the ball of dust with a mace in his face!). You can play against the computer, or head to head, but if you really start wiping the floor with your opponent, they start replacing his/her teammates with all-powerful Trolls!","genre":"Sports/Rugby","manufacturer":"Midway","year":1990,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
