It was subsequently ported to the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 (under the title Aero Blasters) and for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991.\r\n\r\nIn Air Buster, the player controls a fighter jet also designed for space travel and shoots enemies, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels. As a console game, Air Buster had the distinction of being two player simultaneous, which was rare among side scrolling shooters on home consoles at the time.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Kaneko (Namco license)","year":1990,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
