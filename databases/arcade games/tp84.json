It is the sequel to Time Pilot. The player pilots a craft over many time periods. Unlike the original which told the year of each level, the new time periods are designated by new enemies and different colors.\r\n\r\nThere are a large number of enemy types in the game. They each have varying movement patterns, difficulty, and point values. The first button is used to fire a standard shot, which can destroy green-colored enemies. The second button is used to fire missiles, which can destroy the silver-colored enemies. You need to lock on to a silver enemy to fire missiles at it. Destroying enough green enemies brings out a large silver \"boss\" enemy that must be dispatched before advancing to the next level.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
