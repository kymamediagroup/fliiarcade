The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots.  \r\n \r\nDuring the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points. \r\n \r\nAt the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. \"1942\" differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Capcom","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
