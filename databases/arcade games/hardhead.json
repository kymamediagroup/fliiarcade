You fight these creatures with your bubble gun that forms a bubble a round them and lifts them up. \r\n\r\nThe bubble will break after a while, and jumping them on the head will kill them permanently. A stage can be completed if you kick a soccer ball in a goal at the end of each stage. You can play solo or with a friend.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"SunA","year":1988,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"41314ac1"}
