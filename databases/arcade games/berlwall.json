These holes act as traps for the many patrolling monsters and once one has fallen into a hole, the player may then use the hammer on the monster to make it fall through the hole and down to the platform below - causing it to change into fruit or power-ups, which can then be collected.\r\n\r\nKaneko planned to do a Sega Genesis conversion of this game but it was never released.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Kaneko","year":1991,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"d8fe869d"}
