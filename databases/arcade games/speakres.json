An alien fleet has assembled. Only your ship stands between the marauding hordes and a nearby planet with stranded astronauts. The aliens send out formations of fighters to deal with the player and to capture stranded astronauts from the surface of the planet. Your mission is to destroy all of the aliens before they completely de-populate the planet.\r\n\r\nThe player starts the game with three lives and ten figures on the planet's surface. Lives are lost by crashing into aliens or their missiles. Aliens will frequently grab figures from the planets surface. These can be recovered by shooting the vessel before it returns to the fleet. Various events, such as a human being captured or rescued, or a wave of aliens being defeated, are accompanied by digitally synthesized voice effects.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Sun Electronics","year":1980,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
