Completing a solid grid level eliminates those blocks, while others stack up towards you. The game has New Age-type background music and an ominous, talking Max Headroom-like character.\r\n\r\nBlock Out is a Tetris variant with an added twist: it's in 3D. The player can rotate the blocks in 3D in order to fit them into the pit they are being guided into. Advanced users can play this game with odd three-dimensional pieces, or change the size of the pit, for depth of between 6 and 18 piles, and width and length of between 3 and 7.","genre":"Puzzle","manufacturer":"Technos Japan / California Dreams","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
