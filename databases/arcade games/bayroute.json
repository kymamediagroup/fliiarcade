As you run along and shoot or avoid the enemy there are elements of platform action as you can move up or down various levels of the screen. You are able to shoot in multiple directions and certain terrorists when shot leave behind an icon which gives you better fire-power. You will also encounter various vehicles like bikes, planes, flying armoured ships, and guns that fire multiple bullets. At the end of each stage is a base heavily defended by guns and you must destroy all the guns to move to the next stage. If you are hit by any terrorist, vehicle or bullet then you lose one of three lives and two players can play at the same time on the screen.","genre":"Action","manufacturer":"Sunsoft / Sega","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
