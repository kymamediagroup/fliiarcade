Any contact with the spikes, either with the balloon or the box, destroys the balloon. Using a four-way joystick, the player moves the box through the maze and toward the goal, ensuring that the swinging balloon avoids the spikes.\r\nThe player collects points as the box moves closer to the goal (backtracking earns no points). Certain areas of the maze are colored green and purple, and the player will earn more points if the balloon and box pass through the area safely. While there is no time limit, the player cannot wait for a long time; otherwise, a face will appear and blow the balloon into the spikes.\r\nAs the player completes mazes, individual spikes, or even the entire maze, may begin moving or scrolling.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Taito Corporation","year":1980,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
