If you win the game you move on to the next level, each time the opponent gets harder to beat. When you start playing you can choose one of 6 teams: Italy, England, Brazil, West Germany, Austria, or France. The sequel Exciting Soccer II was released in 1984 with Japan replacing Austria and new music, but identical gameplay.  \r\n \r\nThe game allows for one or two players to play and has a control scheme where they can tackle, shoot, short pass, and long pass. Exciting Soccer had realistic touches for the time: corner kicks, throw-ins, penalty shots, and cheerleaders, as well as digitized voices and an influential overhead view.","genre":"Sports/Soccer","manufacturer":"Alpha Denshi Co.","year":1983,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"8a9c0edf"}
