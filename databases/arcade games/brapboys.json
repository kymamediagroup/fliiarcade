The game features three player simultaneous action using characters that are different from one another (rather than palette swaps), and the optional use of weapons and vehicles, as well as a more robust fighting system. The game's soundtrack was notable for having extensively sampled studio recordings from hip-hop group 3 Stories High.","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Kaneko","year":1992,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
