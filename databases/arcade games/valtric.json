Obstacles block the path of the vehicle, and progress through an area is made by the player moving the vehicle upwards, scrolling the screen downwards. Bombs can be dropped directly above the vehicle, similar to Xevious. The player can pick up power-ups that enhance weapons, as well as attach 'options' to the vehicle, drones similar to those of Gradius. The 'options' fire in a direction depending on where they are attached to the main vehicle. The player can avoid danger by jumping.\r\n\r\nThe game is divided into 4 different areas, followed by the same 4 areas in more challenging versions.\r\n\r\nEnemies consist of infinitely respawning smaller moving enemies, stationary cannons, and large boss enemies and enemy bases.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"NMK (Jaleco license)","year":1986,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"d5f9bfb9"}
