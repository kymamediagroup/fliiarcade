As usual, the goal is to keep the ball in the game by bouncing it back with the paddles. Hitting bumpers and other obstacles rewards points and completing a table requires mastering certain objectives which depend on the table on hand. Every table is divided into twp parts with their own paddles: the game only scrolls if the ball goes down. The four tables are:\r\nVolcano: The winning condition is to spell the table's name by using the associated volcano lanes.\r\nRuins: In the middle of the table there is a \"collect ball\" hole. If all targets were hit and two balls were collected in the hole, a special fire ball is set loose. The stage is won when bringing this ball into the hole.\r\nSaqqarah: This pyramid themed table also required spelling a name by knocking down targets and hitting a special hole.\r\nThe last table introduces Breakout elements: the player needs to hit blocks to vaporize them.\r\nThe first three tables can be freely selected and the last one is unlocked by beating the other three.","genre":"Pinball","manufacturer":"Sega","year":1987,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"9db7eddf"}
