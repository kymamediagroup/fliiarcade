Harry is certainly not happy with this, and goes on a rampage, destroying workers that get in his way. As Harry, you can destroy workers in one of two ways: you can smash them when one of them gets near them, or you can pound the ground, and by doing this, you will send shockwaves in both directions. \r\n\r\nThere are four environments in which Harry needs to get through: construction sites, sewer, ship, and the mansion where Harry meets the leader who ordered the demolition of his house. At the end of each environment, a boss needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next environment. In between these, there are bonus stages in which you have to destroy a number of enemies before time runs out.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Irem","year":1990,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"faaacaff"}
