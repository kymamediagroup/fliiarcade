The player controls a typical spaceship. He has one single objective: he must destroy incoming enemies. The spaceship has two weapons - primary gun with infinite ammo and a bombs (very limited ammo). Game has no \"end\" - so \"surface of a planet\" and a \"space field\" backgrounds repeat with increased difficulty until the player has lost three lives (on its default setting).","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Capcom","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"4921635c"}
