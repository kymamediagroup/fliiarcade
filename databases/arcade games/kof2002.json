The King of Fighters 2002 also has five characters exclusive to the X-Box, the PS2 and/or Dreamcast systems: Shingo Yabuki, King, Geese Howard, \"Riot of the Blood\" Iori and Leopold Goenitz. Shingo and King are available on all the non-Neo Geo systems, while Geese and the rest are only available on the PS2 and X-Box platforms.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay system has also changed. The striker system and four-character teams found in the last three KOF releases have been totally removed. In their place are the old-school three man teams and the \"Advanced system\" from The King of Fighters '97 and The King of Fighters '98.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"Eolith / Playmore","year":2002,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Animated Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
