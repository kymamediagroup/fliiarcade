Inc. in 1982.\r\n\r\nGood little shooter with a twist. You are dropping (very fast) depthcharges into the sea below, attacking waves of submarines and other underwater craft who are sending up mines as well as surface-breaking missiles.\r\n\r\nFast and fluid gameplay with great sound effects and music.\r\n\r\nThis game actually plays 'Rydeen' from the Yellow Magic Orchestra, as well as 'Here comes the sun' from the Beatles, very cheeky!","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Sigma Enterprises Inc.","year":1983,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
