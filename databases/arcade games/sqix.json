The game features similar gameplay of controlling a marker drawing lines in order to acquire territory till the required percentage of that round is hit. The game features sixteen rounds to play through.\r\n\r\nSuper Qix offers a new wrinkle to the previous game's formula with the addition of power-ups that appear after a rectangle is completed. Power-ups includes things such as bonus points, increased speed, a shield that allows one hit from an enemy, and temporary frozen enemies. Sometimes instead of a power-up, a letter will appear. If enough letters are collected, they will spell a word which will earn the player bonus points.\r\n\r\nIf the player goes above their call of duty and collect a higher percent of the territory than required of them, they will earn bonus points. If they collect 98% or more of the territory, the player will earn an extra life.","genre":"Puzzle","manufacturer":"Kaneko / Taito","year":1987,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
