There is also a genuine feeling of being challenged but never overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThe game scrolls at various speeds forwards and even backwards while fighting the end-of-level bosses. Shooting certain enemies releases power-ups and bonuses. There are different main weapon systems such as rapid-firing guns, lasers, bombs etc. that give the game a limited strategy. Certain levels and sections are easier complete with particular weapons.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Data East Corporation","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
