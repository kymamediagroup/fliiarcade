There are six players to choose from, they all have a variety of characteristics and techniques. Two players can also play against each other, though doubles matches aren't available. One credit lasts for a number of lost points (the number of points is determined by a DIP switch setting). The game has a 3 button layout: hard, soft and lob shot. Pressing combinations of these buttons achieve advanced shots, such as top spin, slice, drop shot and super volley. There's also a replay feature accessible by pressing the start button to watch effective plays.","genre":"Sports/Tennis","manufacturer":"Art & Magic","year":1993,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
