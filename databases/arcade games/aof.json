The game's story focuses on Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia traveling to South Town to rescue Yuri from the clutches of gangsters. In two-player mode, you take on each other in battle by punching and kicking each other while attempting strong-arms. There is even a \"taunt\" button. Unique for fighting games of the early '90s, the characters are larger and more detailed in Art of Fighting, and a \"camera\" zooms in and out of the action depending on the distance between the fighters.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1992,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Animated Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
