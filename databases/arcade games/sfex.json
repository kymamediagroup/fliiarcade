In many ways, EX still plays like a 2D fighting game, but the linear plane in which characters fight often changes along a 3D battleground. The game uses special moves and super combos familiar or similar to previous games in the series. Like in Alpha and Darkstalkers, the super combo gauge, used to do Super Combos and other moves, was divided into three levels. The game introduces various new features to enhance the player's combat choices.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"Capcom / Arika","year":1996,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Life Like Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
