Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.\r\n\r\nThe game (more precisely, the European PAL version of it) is known for being the origin of the grammatically incorrect phrase in the English translation, All your base are belong to us, which has since become an internet phenomenon.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Toaplan","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
