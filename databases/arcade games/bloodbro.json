It is a spiritual sequel to Cabal, with almost identical mechanics. A bootleg of this game is known as West Story.\r\n\r\nIn Blood Bros., two blood brothers, a cowboy and an Indian, team-up to hunt down \"the most wanted outlaw in Dodge City,\" Big Bad John. The gameplay mechanics are extremely similar to TAD Corp.'s earlier machine, Cabal, however this game did not seem to appear as a trackball-controlled variant.\r\n\r\nThe setting is the Wild West where the player moves a cross hairs and shoot at objects on a stationary screen. The player character can duck and roll along a one dimensional plane. A boss must be defeated before advancing to the next level.\r\n\r\nLicensed to Fabtek for US manufacture and distribution.","genre":"Shooter","manufacturer":"TAD Corporation","year":1990,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
