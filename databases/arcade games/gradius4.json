As with other Gradius titles, you control the highly advanced Vic Viper space fighter against hordes of foes. Weapons can be selected from pre-arranged configurations. The game can be played by a single player, or by two players in alternating turns.\r\n\r\nThe game introduced an online scoring system where a passcode was given at the end of the game. If registered online it would add the score to an online ranking system. This service was discontinued in August 1999.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1998,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
