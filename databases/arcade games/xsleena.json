You run from left to right, shooting your way to the base at the end of each level, then tackle a left to right space ship stage.\r\n\r\nPick up various power-up weapons and attack the end of level boss on each planet. After each space stage there is a spectacular finale. Firing constantly while moving forward is the best method. However, there is a bonus stage after you complete the five planets that is extremely difficult. It is best to avoid everything here whenever possible.\r\n\r\nCOPY OF: Solar-Warrior\r\n\r\nTechnos produced the original that spawned two other versions: Solar-Warrior by Memetron in the US, and Soldier of Light by Taito in the UK -- both 1987. Soldier of Light was the name on the UK cabinet, but the game showed Xain'd Sleena on the screen with the Taito logo instead of Technos.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Technos Japan","year":1986,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
