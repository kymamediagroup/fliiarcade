Collecting these gems will 'power-up' the player's character, giving them more powerful attacks. There are two bars and three sub-bars in the interface. The two main bars are the life bar and the super bar; the first indicates the player's health and the second their ability to throw super combos. The Super Bar itself can be filled up to nine levels, allowing players to execute more super combos. Each super combo has a level assigned to it, and it uses Super Bars depending on it.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"Capcom","year":1997,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
