As the name implies, it is loosely based on (and not licensed by) the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Bronze or silver medals are not good enough - you have to go for the gold to get to the next event. However, you must at least qualify in each event in order to compete in the next event.","genre":"Sports/Track & Field","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1988,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
