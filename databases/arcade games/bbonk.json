In this game, players take the role of mice in a small playfield with a few bigfoot feet that must be avoided in addition to the walls.\r\n\r\nThe game is 2-player only, and both players are in a survival match to see who can avoid crashing longest. As players move about the playfield, they leave a trail behind. Hitting any part of the trails, or the bigfoot feet, causes a player to lose that round and gives one point to their opponent. First one to six wins the game.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Meadows Games, Inc.","year":1976,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
