According to the game's arcade brochure, Mama Top had three games under development, but only the first one was released.\r\nThe player controls a mother bird named Birdiy that gives birth to a baby bird, whom she has to feed by fetching worms on the leaves and from underground, while having to go near two monster rats to make them go away before one of them eat the baby bird and cause a life loss. Birdiy can also accelerate by pressing the action button, but this can only be performed when moving downwards.\r\n\r\nOnce Birdiy feeds her baby with every worm on the level, the round is beaten.","genre":"Action","manufacturer":"Mama Top","year":1983,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
