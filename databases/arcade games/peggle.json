The game is played with a single controller which is used to both rotate the pegs and move the cups left and right. The aim of the game is simply to clear all pegs in each level which happens when they are touched by the ball. Pegs of certain colours require multiple hits but are also worth more points. The cups at the bottom have different properties. Some of them give bonuses in terms of extra time or points while others cause the ball to bounce back up to the pegs again.","genre":"Ball & Paddle","manufacturer":"Strata/Incredible Technologies","year":1991,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
