The more Zupipi on an enemy when he is trampled, the larger the explosion.\r\n\r\nThe game is similar to Nightmare In The Dark, another action puzzler released the same year from SNK. This game, originally completed in 1994 but released in 2001, it has a few more refined features including the ability to jump down.\r\n\r\nPlayers must collect the four small Zupipi creatures in order to use them against their opponents. There are many power-ups that can be used as well, including speed-up, power-up (throws all Zupipi at once), power-ups that make jumps worth 100 points, etc.\r\n\r\nBonus stages allow a player to collect fruit and goodies for points. There are nine stages, six selectable from the start of the game. On each stage the enemies and boss reflect a common theme.\r\n\r\nLong rumored a lost title, and shown on many Neo Prototype pages as a 1994 proto, Zupapa finally sees the light of day in 2001.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"SNK","year":2001,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
