Volfied is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an ship/object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along. When not cutting the ship is protected by a shield the shield decreases over time and when it hits zero the enemies can also killl you when not cutting.\r\n\r\nThe player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points. Most levels contain power-up blocks these power-ups can be claimed when the area around it is removed. Possible power-ups are increased speed (S), time frees for the enemies (T), pause you shield from counting down (P), a laser to shoot the smaller enemies (L), all smaller enemies are killed instantly (C) and a weapon to kill the boss (a red tomato only found in blocks with the red light).\r\n\r\nThis game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.","genre":"Puzzle","manufacturer":"Taito Corporation Japan","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"2763ec89"}
