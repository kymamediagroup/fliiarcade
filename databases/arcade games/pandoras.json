Pandorazu Paresu?) is a platformer game developed by Konami and released on Arcade platforms in 1984. Unlike most Konami arcade games, the game was only released in America. Interlogic published the game (they also published Mega Zone and Roc'n Rope in US arcades)\r\nPandora's Palace is a platformer game in which the player takes on the role of a Roman emperor and must make his way from the top left corner of the screen to the exit generally located at the bottom right corner. In order to do this, he has to use the columns and moving platforms.\r\n\r\nThe task won't be easy, however, many monsters such as skulls and monsters heads or Moais will prevent him for doing so. These enemies won't kill the emperor directly on contact, but they will instead push him toward fires or over the edge of platforms. If this happen this will result in a loss of a life.\r\n\r\nHowever, the player can collect the wine grapes items for points and power-ups. Collecting them will transform the Emperor temporarily, switching from a tunic and laurel guy to a full-fledged Roman Warrior with armor and helmet. In this mode, the emperor can destroy the enemies by jumping on their heads, and gains additional bonus points.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Konami / Interlogic","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
