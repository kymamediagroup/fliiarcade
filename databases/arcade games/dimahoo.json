The player picks one of four friends to travel with. The two characters fly through the levels in the game and collect items. Each item has a point value and the points are used to fill up a chart at the end. The items include: food, swords, armors, boots, etc. Towards the end of the game, the bosses become incredibly hard. The fast backgrounds create a confusing state of mind for the player.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Eighting / Raizing (Capcom license)","year":2000,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
