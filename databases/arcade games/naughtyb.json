The boy must avoid monsters while attempting to make it to the top of each level and proceed on to the next. There are a number of flags at the top of each level that must be destroyed in order to proceed to next level.\r\nOccasionally, there is a bonus round where your character flys back and forth at the top of the screen in a hot-air balloon in an attempt to drop rocks down upon a monster that is running at the bottom of the screen. There is a fuel gauge that determines when the bonus round will end.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Jaleco","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
