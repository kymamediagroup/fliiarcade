Collect potions, power-ups and bonus items from the treasure chests left by slain enemies. Defeat the boss enemies to proceed to the next level.\r\n\r\nUse the Sword button to swing the character's weapon at enemies and their projectile attacks. When a treasure chest appears, you must first walk over it and then wait for the item to appear before it can be collected. Try to remain in the center of the screen and only fight enemies when necessary since the character's health decreases rapidly when under attack.\r\nIn some areas, the screen scrolls quite rapidly so it is important to keep moving. If the character becomes trapped behind a wall as the screen scrolls, a life will be lost.\r\n\r\nThe game plays similar to Gun.Smoke except with a mythical fantasy theme.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Taito Corporation","year":1986,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"866eab0e"}
