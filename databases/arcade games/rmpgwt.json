The 'World Tour' of the title refers to the fact that the action now takes place around the entire world, instead of just North America. Graphics are much improved and a kick button has been added to allow even more chaos. \r\n \r\nHidden bonus items have also been added to the game; two examples are an item that allows any player character to transport to almost any location in the game instantly. A second gives the players more destructive power. Some stages have a vat of toxic chemicals that can mutate any player character into a huge purple bat-like creature called V.E.R.N (Violently Enraged Radioactive Nemesis) for the duration of the stage.","genre":"Action","manufacturer":"Midway","year":1997,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
