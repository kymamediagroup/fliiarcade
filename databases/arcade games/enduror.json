Each course is littered with logs, rocks, trees and rival racers that must be either jumped over or avoided. \r\n \r\nJumps can only be performed at specific locations on each track. These locations feature a dirt ramp that spreads across the width of the track. Players must have the bike in the 'wheelie' position when the ramp is struck, the bike will then be launched into the air. If the bike is not in a wheelie position when the ramps are struck, the bike will still clear the ramp, but will land front-wheel first and crash. \r\n \r\nEnduro Racer is perhaps best remembered for its 'Wheelie' feature, which required the player to physically lift the cabinet's handlebars to raise the front wheel of the game's on-screen counterpart.","genre":"Motorcycle","manufacturer":"Sega","year":1986,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
