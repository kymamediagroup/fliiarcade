Unlike in previous games of the series, there are four characters per team instead of three, with the fourth serving as a \"Striker\", a fighter whose function is only to enter a match, attack the opponent and leave without replacing their teammates. In total, there are seven teams, each containing four characters, four Team Edit characters and a boss.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1999,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
