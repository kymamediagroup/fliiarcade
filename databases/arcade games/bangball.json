Player 1 controls a mouse on a skateboard and player 2 a mouse on roller skates trying to rescue their girlfriend who has been kidnapped by a bunch of cats. The gameplay remains largely the same - throw colored balls at matching balls of the same color to clear the stage. Unlike the first game though there's no button to lock direction, instead there's a 2 player co-op mode (Mouse Shooter GoGo only had a 2 player versus mode). Also, collision with the balls diminishes player's health, in the original game you needed to restart the stage if you were hit once, this game has a life bar (2-5 hits depending on the DIP switch settings).\r\n\r\nThe Korean version called Battle Bubble retains the same gameplay, but has different backgrounds","genre":"Puzzle","manufacturer":"Banpresto / Kunihiko Tashiro+Goodhouse","year":1996,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
