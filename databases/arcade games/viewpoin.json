The PlayStation and Saturn versions feature 3D rendered graphics with texture maps, unlike the other versions which primarily feature shaded polygons.\r\n\r\nOne or two players (in hot-seat or cooperative mode) control a spaceship equipped with a laser cannon which can be charged (by holding the shooting button down) for a stronger blast. Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Sammy / Aicom","year":1992,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"40d69f1e"}
