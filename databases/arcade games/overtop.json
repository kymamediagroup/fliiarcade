Players can choose from several different vehicle types. Pure racing fans can race in a Ferrari sports car, while motorcycle enthusiasts can race using a bike. Players looking for more exotic vehicles to race can even choose the truck, Hummer, or van. Each vehicle has its own handling characteristics and performs differently on various terrain types.\r\n\r\nA large screen showing a simplified overhead map of the current course section takes up part of the top left section of the screen. The map shows players their current location as well as the course ahead, giving them a chance to react to turns before they see them. Just before a turn, the game also provides more help in the form of blinking arrows indicating the direction that the course is heading.","genre":"Driving","manufacturer":"ADK","year":1996,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
