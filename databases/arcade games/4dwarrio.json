By flying over the top of the play field, you end up in an alternate universe. You travel back and forth defeating enemies until you reach a boss creature. On some occasions a worm hole will appear in the middle of the play field and you are taken to even stranger worlds.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Coreland / Sega","year":1985,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
