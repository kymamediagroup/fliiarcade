The game is officially licensed by the NBC television network.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth game in the wildly popular NBA Jam/NBA Hangtime series and the fourth from Midway. In this version, the game is presented in three dimensions and is accelerated by 3Dfx hardware. It also has exclusive NBA on NBC sponsorship. Naturally, the game has the NBC feel to it, with all the graphics and sounds used in NBC's NBA coverage. The official NBA license allows over 160 NBA players to be included in the game, 5-7 per team, each with his own ratings and photo.","genre":"Sports/Basketball","manufacturer":"Midway","year":1999,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
