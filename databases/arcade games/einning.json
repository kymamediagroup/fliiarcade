The game is almost identical to Double Play with some adjustments: The pitching player's joystick is 8-way instead of a rotary joystick. An extra inning (e.g. bonus round) is awarded when all bonus letters that spell MIDWAY are hit with the ball.","genre":"Sports/Baseball","manufacturer":"Midway / Taito","year":1978,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"56b407d4"}
