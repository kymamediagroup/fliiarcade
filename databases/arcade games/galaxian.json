Each screen starts with a wave of multi-colored aliens moving left and right at the top of the screen; the aliens quickly break ranks and start dive-bombing the Galaxip (player's ship) - either in single units or in groups of 3 - dropping multiple missiles as they descend. All of the aliens need to be destroyed before the player can progress to the next wave.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Namco","year":1979,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
