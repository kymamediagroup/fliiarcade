Equipped with a beam cannon to shoot its way through the waves of enemy battle groups, the player's ship moves continuously forward along the structures' walls, with the camera behind; the view shifts and rotates along with the ship.\r\n\r\nTravel can be sped up or slowed down, but the ship's power drains at a constant rate - losing it completely will disable your guns. Power can only be recharged by successfully docking with the mothership at the end of each mission, which also awards a score bonus. In the game world's many tubular sections you will encounter indestructible roadblocks, armored mini-bosses, and the occasional \"warp holes\" (which safely transport your ship some distance ahead).","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Nichibutsu / Fujitek","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
