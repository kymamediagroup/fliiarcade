Eight unique fighters must be faced in succession by using punches, kicks, and jumping against the progressively more difficult adversaries.\r\n\r\nThe arcade version features a cooperative two-player mode, but this was excluded in the PS Mini release. As an unique feature of the Genesis version players can bet money on the outcome of the fights, and if they win they can use that money to upgrade the character stats to suit their playing style. Also added to the Genesis version are a Vs mode and a new special move that depletes part of your lifebar.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
