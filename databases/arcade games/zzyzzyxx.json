Avoid contact with Rattifers who chase you and seek to destroy you. Bonus objects allow you to imprison Rattifers inside of bricks.\r\n\r\nYou move the hero character up and down the screen gathering gifts for Lola. There are rows of blocks that move either left or right and you can move your character into an empty spot. There are also enemies that move into the spaces who are trying to catch you. If you press the \"Make Brick\" button, the space you are in will be filled in with a brick and you will be safe from enemies for a short period of time -- until the next empty space passes by. After you've gathered enough gifts to make Lola happy, she will whistle and you can move to her spot.\r\n\r\nThe game is also known as Brix.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Cinematronics / Advanced Microcomputer Systems","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
