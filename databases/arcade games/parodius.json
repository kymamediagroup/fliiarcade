The gameplay is stylistically very similar to the Gradius Series, but the graphics and music are intentionally absurd.\r\n\r\nThis game is often mistaken as the original game of the series. The lesser known original game, Parodius, appeared on the MSX computer (in Japan only).\r\n\r\nThe Great Octopus has threatened Earth. To help Parodius save the planet, you and his friends must begin your search for the truth. As you search the whole world over you must find the enemy and you must destroy him.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1990,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
