The humans/creatures are in various formations, some just appear and others sometimes leave the formation and move down the screen. Occasionally a man with a cart moves across the screen and if shot allows you to collect a bonus. As you shoot the enemy to clear the screen, they will fire back and if you are hit by their weapon or allow them to reach the bottom of the screen, then you lose one of three lives. Once a screen is cleared, then you will face a boss who needs multiple hits to destroy him.","genre":"Shooter","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1987,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
