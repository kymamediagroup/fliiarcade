Depending on the aiming, the bubbles may float up directly or bounce off the walls, changing their trajectory. The goal is to aim the bubbles in such a way that they will touch identically colored ones. When such bubbles form a group of three or more, they pop and disappear from the screen.","genre":"Puzzle","manufacturer":"Taito","year":1994,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
