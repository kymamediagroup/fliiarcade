Also, as players approached the end of each stage, they were presented with a fork in the road; a unique innovation that gave players a choice of which route they wished to take through the game.\r\nAs well as being able to choose which route they wished to take, players could also - via the game's \"in-car radio\" - choose one of three different catchy tunes to listen to while driving. The songs are 'Magical Sound Shower', 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'.,\r\n","genre":"Driving","manufacturer":"Sega","year":1986,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
