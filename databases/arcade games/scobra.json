Success depends on how far you can penetrate enemy airspace. Can you handle the pressure? Because the further you go, the more difficult the mission becomes. Show that you've got what it takes by maneuvering your chopper around craggy mountain peaks, through deep dark tunnels, and over tall city buildings. All while you face enemy tanks and missiles and weird sky-flying weapons. But you can fight back with high-flying, quick-thinking, fast-reaction moves. Good luck and good flying!","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1981,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
