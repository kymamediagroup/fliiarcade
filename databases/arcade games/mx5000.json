Fire missiles at aircraft and bomb ground targets. Features end-of-level bosses, good music, digitized speech, big explosions, and lots of power-ups.\r\n\r\nThe game is good looking graphically but features a jerky looking scrolling background. It's quite tough to play and looks more like a 1990's shoot-em-up than a late 80's game. It's a small sized PCB, approximately six inches square, and features a large number of Konami custom chips, similar in look to \"Rush 'n' Attack.\" The digitized speech, apart from 'congratulations', is really hard to understand.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1987,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
