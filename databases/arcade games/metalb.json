Both attacks can be powered up by collecting Newalone, which floats around freely in stages. The beam weapon becomes a screen covering burst attack when the maximum amount of Newalone has been collected. The Burst can be refocused to a beam by holding down the beam button.\r\n\r\nBosses also use beam attacks, and one can duel with the bosses by countering with a beam attack. The outcome of these duels depends on the accumulated Newalone.\r\n\r\nTwo special stages exist where one has to lock onto enemies in a pseudo 3D space and fire missiles. The random nature of these stages, combined with the fact that score largely depends on fast lockons, has been the target of criticism.\r\n\r\nAn alternative ending can be viewed by dying and not continuing on the last stage.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Taito Corporation Japan","year":1991,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
