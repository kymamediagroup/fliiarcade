Battles end when one of the monsters is pinned for a three count or if time expires (in which case the player loses).\r\nThe game consists of 12 total levels: the player first must defeat all six monsters, with the last monster being oneself, but in a different palette. Then the player must defeat the six monsters again, in the same order, but this time in different cities.\r\nMega criticised the game, awarding it a score of 10%, with Andy Dyer making the comment \"unforgivably bad.
