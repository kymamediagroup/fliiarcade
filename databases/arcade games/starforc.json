Each stage in the game was named after a letter of the Greek alphabet. In certain versions of the game, there is an additional level called \"Infinity\" (represented by the infinity symbol) which occurs after Omega, after which the game repeats indefinitely.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Tehkan","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
