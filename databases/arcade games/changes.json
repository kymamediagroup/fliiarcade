The caterpillar changes into a butterfly after everything has been eaten.\r\n\r\nThe game is quite similar to Pac-Man.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar must eat all the nuts and strawberries in order to become a butterfly.\r\nEating a strawberry temporarily makes the caterpillar invincible allowing it to kill the deadly bugs and score bonus points. The caterpillar can only run away from the hungry bird when it appears on the screen. Whenever the caterpillar leaves a turning branch, all the turning branches will rotate at once, and any bugs that are on those branches will fall off and score 400, 800, 1600 and even 3200 points. The caterpillar can also eat the beautiful flowers to score bonus points.\r\n\r\nAfter you have clear the entire screen of all the nuts and strawberries, the caterpillar will change into a colorful butterfly. Afterwards, the game will begin again but with increased difficulty. The game was developed and published by Orca, however in North America Eastern Micro Electronics had the publishing license.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Orca","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
