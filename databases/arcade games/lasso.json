In it you play a rancher/cowboy trying to round-up his cattle with a rope.\r\n\r\nThe game generously gives you an opportunity to practise throwing the lasso at the beginning with a �warm-up� screen. Then you have to catch loose sheep and shoot fireballs at attacking wolves� Ah, you can�t make this stuff up� Let a wolf or any of your cattle touch you, though, and you lose a life. Lose all three lives and it�s game over.\r\n\r\nIf you complete the sheep level, it�s then onto the cow level at a slightly harder difficulty; then the horse level. And so on. Extra hazards, like fire(?) breathing lizards, also become more frequent as the stages progress.","genre":"Miscellaneous","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
