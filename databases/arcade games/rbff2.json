The match system using 2 battle plans (foreground/background) remains semi-intact, because now some battle fields (like Cheng Sinzan's stage) uses a single plane, forcing the players to use only the basic defense to avoid attacks.\r\n\r\nBut the main addition of this title (and the reason for subtitle \"The Newcomers\") are 2 new characters entering for Fatal Fury's main cast: Rick Strowd, a mysterious fighter with a particular fighting style and Li Xiangfei, a young female Chinese martial arts fighter.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1998,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Animated Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
