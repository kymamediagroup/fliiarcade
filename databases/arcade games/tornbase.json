The game is very simple in terms of rules, and anybody can pick up on how to play fairly quickly. This is a two player only title, with both people playing for a single quarter. The pitching player selects his pitch with one joystick, while moving his outfielders with a second one. The batting player only has a single button (that is a 'swing' button). Both players use the same set of controls, so they must switch spots in front of the machine midway through each inning. You get a four inning game for one quarter, although that number can be adjusted by the game operator.","genre":"Sports/Baseball","manufacturer":"Midway / Taito","year":1976,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
