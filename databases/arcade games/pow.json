The game consists of three action buttons for punching, kicking and jumping. There are also three special attacks performed by pressing two buttons simultaneously: a jump kick (jump, then kick), a back punch (jump and punch simultaneously) and a headbutt (punch and kick simultaneously). \r\n \r\nThe controls change when wielding a weapon; the knife is thrown by pressing the punch button, but can preserved by using kicks. When wielding the machine gun, players can fire it by pressing the kick button, or can conserve its ammo by pressing the punch button to gun-whip enemies from close-range.","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1988,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
