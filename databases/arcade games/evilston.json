It's a beat em up, but rather than taking place on a traditional scrolling path, it takes place on grids of floating rocks. Furthermore, it's a beat em up in which the player has no kind of health counter, and can theoretically take an endless number of hits without dying.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Spacy Industrial, Ltd.","year":1990,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"eb4f895c"}
