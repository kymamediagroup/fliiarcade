This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.\r\n\r\nThe Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Irem (licensed from Broderbund)","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
