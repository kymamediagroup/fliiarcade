Players go through several zones of enemy territories in order to reach their last destination, the Mega Zone to have a final showdown with the enemies command tower.\r\n\r\nPlayers pilot an amphibious rocket tank and get to shoot at 32 different kinds of enemies. If the player collects twelve power energy pods it causes a \"MEG\" (short from Mega) power-up to appear. Getting this power-up makes the tank combine with another tank and triples the size and the firepower of the tank. On the way to the Mega Zone, players will occasionally reach a fork in which they can choose which path they want to take.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1983,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
