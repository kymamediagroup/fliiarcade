The gameplay is the same as in the original but the design of the race circuit is different. The centre part of the playfield is like the original tracks but with only four lanes. On both sides of the screen there are two additional lanes. These additional lanes affect the gameplay as they allow the player or the AI car to turn around and move in the reverse direction. This means that the player not only has to watch out for cars in front of him but also cars chasing from behind. Another difference from the original game is that later levels can have as many as four AI controlled cars.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Sega","year":1979,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"9617d796"}
