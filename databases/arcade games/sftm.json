While a game of the same name was released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, it is not a port but a separately produced game based on the same movie. The arcade version of Street Fighter: The Movie differs from the previous Street Fighter II games in several ways: the game gives a greater emphasis towards air combos or \"juggling\" than previous games. The player can continuously attack their opponent while they're falling in the air with a series of attacks. Additionally, players can cancel any Special Move while performing it into another Special Move. This can even be done with projectile attacks.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"Capcom / Incredible Technologies","year":1995,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
