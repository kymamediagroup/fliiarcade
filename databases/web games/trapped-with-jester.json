Your memory is in shambles.\n\nYou hear the clip-clop of a horse's careful steps.\n\nYou feel shaking around you... and a pair of eyes watching you.\n\nYou are awakened by a voice. An unfamiliar face.\n\nWhere are you? Who are you? Why are you here...?\n\n... AND WHY WON'T THAT ANNOYING STRANGER SHUT UP?!\n\n[Don't worry, it's not scary... I think.]",
