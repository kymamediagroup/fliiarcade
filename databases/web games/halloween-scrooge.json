You decide you’ll skip the festivities this year as you settle into your new home, expecting teenagers to welcome you to the neighbourhood by egging your house and toilet-papering your trees, per Devil’s Night tradition. Instead, you get a visit from 3 handsome Halloween Ghosts, who try to convince you to stop being a scrooge and give the holiday a chance. Will they convince you that it’s worth getting in the Halloween spirit after all? Or will you just spend the entire time trying to flirt with them?",
