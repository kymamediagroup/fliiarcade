Death-defying looping maneuvers can be executed with ease as you attempt to destroy strange flying obstacles and ground targets.\r\n\r\nThe Looping arcade machine contains a series of relatively rare Texas Instruments CPUs and a dedicated DAC (Digital To Analog Converter) sound chip, capable of speaking audible commands to the player throughout his/her mission. The Texas Instruments CPUs are reportedly difficult to find if they need to be replaced, and original hardware is becoming scarce as the years go on.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1982, Looping was one of the two original titled produced by the German company Video Games GmbH. It is said to have been developed in Parma, Italy by Giorgio Ugozoli. It was licensed to Venture Line for US manufacture and distribution, and has seen home release on the Colecovision.\r\n\r\nAn interview with the devloper or Looping, Giorgio Ugozzoli, is available here in English, and here in original Italian!","genre":"Shooter","manufacturer":"Video Games GmbH","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
