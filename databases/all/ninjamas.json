The player must defeat their opponent in combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. Characters can change between using the character's weapon or fight hand-to-hand during the middle of combat. Like the Art of Fighting series, Ninja Master's features a super meter.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"ADK / SNK","year":1996,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Animated Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
