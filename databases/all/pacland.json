It was the first Namco arcade game to use the then-new arcade system later titled as Namco Pac-Land. It was also one of the earlier side-scrolling platform games in video game history, preceding the better-known Super Mario Bros. by Nintendo. Pac-Land features parallax scrolling for some of the background elements, a feature that would not become commonplace until the 16-bit console era began much later.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Namco","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
