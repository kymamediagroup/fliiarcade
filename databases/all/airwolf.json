As the series begins, Dr. Moffet and his crew steal Airwolf during a live-fire weapons test. During the theft, Moffet opens fire on the Firm's bunker, killing a United States Senator and seriously injuring Firm deputy director Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III (codename \"Archangel\"). Moffet takes the gunship to Libya, where he begins performing acts of aggression - such as sinking an American destroyer - as a service for military strongman Muammar Gaddafi, who allows Moffet to keep Airwolf on Libyan soil.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Kyugo","year":1987,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
