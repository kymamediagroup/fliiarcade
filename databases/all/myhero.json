Eventually you will come to a clearing and have to fight a boss - defeating him will briefly reunite you with your girlfriend, before she is kidnapped again. The game loops indefinitely, and ends when the player runs out of lives.","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Coreland / Sega","year":1985,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
