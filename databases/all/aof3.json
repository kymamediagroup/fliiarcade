Yuri Sakazaki is seen in the game, but only as a side character in Ryo and Robert's story mode.\r\n\r\nThe story switched focus from the Sakazakis to Robert Garcia. Garcia disappears to search for an old childhood friend, Freia Lawrence, and he tracks her to GlassHill, Mexico. Freia is wanted by the game's main antagonist, Wyler, to complete a powerful elixir that was created by his and Freia's fathers. The drug affects users in a similar manner as the potion in The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.\r\n\r\nOne of the game's characters, Kasumi Todoh, became a part of The King of Fighters cast. This game is the only one in the series to have a CD Drama Arranged Soundtrack.\r\nIt was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on 21 March 2013 at a cost of 900 Wii Points.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1996,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Animated Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
