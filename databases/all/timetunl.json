Unlike most other maze chase games of the era, the player cannot navigate the maze directly, but instead must rely on their ability to switch the direction of track junctions while moving forward and backward. \r\n\r\nThere are three levels with unique objectives: in the first the player must back into certain sections of the maze to attach passenger cars, in the second they must stop at stations to fill each car with three passengers, and lastly they must drop all of their passengers off at space stations. (Did I mention you are a space train?)\r\n\r\nWhen the three levels are completed, the player can play again at a higher difficulty to achieve a high score.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Taito Corporation","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
