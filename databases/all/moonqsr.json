Your craft begins with three segments, one deployed at a time and after a few levels, you will attempt to refuel and dock the segments together. A successful dock gives you more firepower for the upcoming levels.\r\n\r\nThis game is similar to Moon Cresta (also from Nichibutsu) except there is also a \"refueling\" stage.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Nichibutsu","year":1980,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
