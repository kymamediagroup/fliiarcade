An emergency strike force has been assembled to repel the invaders, with the ultimate goal of destroying the enemy's supreme battleship - Apocalypse, the Saurian Megastar.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise remains two-way horizontally scrolling action as you fly your Aerial Jet Fighter over the planets' surfaces, attacking the invaders and protecting the colonists. Added to your arsenal are a new array of selectable weapons, from mines and homing rockets to devastating air-strikes and atomics; these can be restocked at the interstellar supply center. You also command a small army of space marines in jet-powered battle suits, which can be deployed to collect power-ups, retrieve colonists and add to your firepower. Two simultaneous players may engage the enemy side by side.\r\n\r\nThe unpleasant, neon-green intruders will fight back with anything they can get their hands on, from rocks and handheld weapons to enormous flying death machines. It's up to you to decide which planets to attack, in what order, and when to engage the Megastar in a final battle.","genre":"Shooter","manufacturer":"Midway","year":1991,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
