He can also climb up and down ladders and jump over open holes. He can also even swim across underground streams while avoiding electric eels. Pitfall Harry must also sometimes avoid falling rocks and other plummeting projectiles.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Sega","year":1985,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
