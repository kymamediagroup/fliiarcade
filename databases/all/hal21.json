It is considered a spiritual predecessor to the Alpha Mission series. Gameplay is very similar to Namco's Xevious, with a button for firing regular shots and a button for bombing ground targets, controlled by a crosshair target above the player's ship. One unique feature from HAL 21 is the bosses, which are composed of multiple small parts. Whenever the player hits a boss part, it flies off from the boss's body before reattaching.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1985,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
