The F14 is equipped with a machine gun and a limited number of homing missiles. The gun has infinite ammunition and targeting is achieved by maneuvering the Tomcat so that the targeting cursor situated just in front of the jet is placed over an enemy fighter.  \r\n \r\nAfter Burner's straightforward shoot-em-up gameplay is simple and repetitive, but the game's incredible visuals ensured its success.","genre":"Shooter","manufacturer":"Sega","year":1987,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
