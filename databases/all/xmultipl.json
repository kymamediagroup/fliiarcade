In 1998, the game was released with Image Fight as a one-disc doublebill on PlayStation and Sega Saturn.\r\n\r\nThe game itself is a side-scroller like R-Type, albeit with a short vertical-scrolling area towards the end of the sixth level. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002. Konami's Xexex is based on a fusion of this weaponry with the Force system of R-Type. In the PlayStation 2 game R-Type Final, the ship \"Cross The Rubicon\" uses the \"Flexible Force\", a Force based on XMultiply with roughly the same attacks.\r\n\r\nThe game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249ï¿½the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Irem","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
