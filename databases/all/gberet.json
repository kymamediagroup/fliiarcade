While it's possible to remain still in one area to rack up points, if players take too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There is also an unseen time limit that will kill off players if they take too long to complete the stage.  \r\n \r\nThe game has four stages in total: a missile base, a harbour, an air Base and a Siberian POW Camp. At the end of each stage the Marine will face a group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump-kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs and their handlers, Stage 3 with three Gyro-copters and Stage 4 with a number of multi-shot flamethrower operators.  \r\n \r\nThe game is completed once the captives have been rescued at the end of the fourth stage, after which the action starts over with an increased level of difficulty.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1985,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
