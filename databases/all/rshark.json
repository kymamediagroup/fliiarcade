The player takes the role of a headhunter, and gets to chose to go after one of eight interstellar criminals. Gameplay is similar to a myriad of other shmups: The player in a special space ship flies and shoots at enemies - main interstellar criminals are bosses. His ship has a weak main weapon, and some support in the form of homing missiles, but better weapons like a laser can be acquired. Weapons are also upgradable and offer super attacks.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Dooyong","year":1995,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"5a26ee72"}
