He conquered the industrial city of Atlantis, and is now preparing to take over the world. The United Nations decided to retaliate by sending two of their top class Special Forces officers, Ben and Andy, infiltrate the city and destroy the enemy base using a newly developed time bomb--Sigma.\r\n\r\nUsing a top-down perspective (akin to Gauntlet), the player controls either Ben or Andy, planting bombs and destroying cyborg enemies using guns (the \"machine gun\" and the \"cannon\" can be swapped back and forth) and smart bombs (which wipe out all enemies on screen.) The goal of each stage is to plant all of the bombs and escape before their collective timer goes off.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Sega","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
