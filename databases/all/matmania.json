The player controls a wrestler in a televised event broadcast by the fictional T.W.A. (Taito Wrestling Association in the US version, Technos Wrestling Association in the Japanese version). The wrestler needs to compete against five opponents in a fixed order: Insane Warrior (US) / Insane Worrier (Japan), Karate Fighter, Coco Savage, The Pirania and Golden Hulk (US) / Blues Bloody (Japan). When the five fights are completed successfully a champion belt is presented in a ceremony and then the five fighters needed to be defeated again, but then drawn in a random order.\r\n\r\nThe fighter can be moved in eight directions and only two actions are used to kick and punch. Pressing both buttons simultaneously makes the character run. Based on the position in the ring it is possible to sprint and launch from the ropes, pin a wrestler, get on the ropes, throw a wrestler out of the ring, perform ring jump attacks, holds, grabs, a should block, a headlock, an Irish wisp, a body slam, a piledriver, a vertical suplex, a back body drop, an elbow smash, a clothesline, a jumping kick, a body splash, a sunset flip and a knee drop, and throw the opponent into the environment, also out of the ring.","genre":"Sports/Wrestling","manufacturer":"Technos Japan (Taito America license)","year":1985,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
