Mac has to fight against fighters from across the USA.\r\n\r\nIn the single-player mode you have to defeat a few weaker enemies before the main boss can be fought. If enough have been defeated a rope ladder will appear that will transport you the main boss. The two-player mode plays like a one-on-one versus fighter.","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Home Data","year":1991,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Animated Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
