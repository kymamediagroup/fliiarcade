The early entries are fairly standard side-scrolling shoot-em-ups, and mostly rely on the adorable pink-haired main character, who rides a broom, who attacks with magic spells and has one of the most hilarious death screams in all of video gaming. The original game saw a release in America for the arcades, TurboGrafx-16 Super CD and Neo Geo Pocket Color, but the rest stayed in Japan.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Sega / Success","year":1991,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
