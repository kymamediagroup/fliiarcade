There are two sequences: a fighting sequence and a shooting sequence.\r\n\r\nDuring the fighting sequence, you must fight the bank teller, hit the coyotes and then jump onto the train before it speeds away. When you are on the trian, you must fight your way past other enemies and avoid various projectiles like bottles, bullets and shovels full of coal. Be careful to duck under the low signs that come along as the train is travelling. If you manage to make it to the train engine, the loot will be captured and you will move on to the shooting sequence.\r\n\r\nIn the shooting sequence, you ride on a horse and shoot at enemies appearing from the windows of a train car. They will shoot back at you and throw various objects, but hitting the Duck button will allow you to avoid their attacks. Do not shoot the woman on the train who will be handing over a bag of money, though. If you shoot her, you will lose a life. After the shooting sequence has been completed, the game will start over again with increased difficulty.","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Data East Corporation","year":1986,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"9a8766a7"}
