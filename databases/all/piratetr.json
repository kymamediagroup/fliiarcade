Avoid colliding with the black enemy pirate ship and be aware that this ship can also create a live volcano on one of the islands you raided. If you run into a volcano, your ship will explode.\r\nTry to capture the treasure chest when you see it on one of the islands but sometimes the enemy ship will take it and move it onto another island. Your ship can sometimes move through the top, bottom and sides of the screen but at other times the edges of the screen will be blocked by red lines. Everytime you capture one of the treasures, depending on what stage you are on, the prize can be worth from 1000 to 7000 points plus a bonus for every island you raid after you have captured the treasure.\r\n\r\nThere are seven different stages where you must steal a treasure from one of the infamous pirates including Captain Hook, Captain Kidd, Blackbeard, Long John Silver, Jolly Roger, Pegleg Pete, and The Mad Hackers. After all seven treasures have been captured, there is an intermission where an eye-patched skull and crossbones winks and grins and it says \"Yar! Har! Har! Har! Dead Men Tell No Tales!\" After that, the stages start all over again, but with increased difficulty. You have three ships at the beginning of the game and you are rewarded an extra ship at 90,000 points.","genre":"Miscellaneous","manufacturer":"Tong Electronic","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
