Each toad has his own unique attacks and super-moves. A quarter-pumper with great sound and graphics.\r\n\r\nYou can choose from any of the three Toads: Rash a lean and fast fighter, Zitz a smart and balanced toad, or Pimple a big, bad powerhouse. Each has his own fighting style as well as his own repertoire of big-time Smash Hits that will be used to eliminate enemies. This game can appear to be just a beat-'em-up at first, but almost every level is different. Some levels are two and a half dimensional, like Double Dragon, and others are just two dimentional, giving you the ability to duck. One level has you hovering down a tunnel with a jet pack. On the last level, you ride in a hovering cruiser and fire at enemies with four different types of guns and a special weapon.\r\n\r\nAt various points in the stages, flies will appear. Just face them and attack, and your toad will snake out with his tongue and gobble them up to help regain lost health.","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Rare","year":1994,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
