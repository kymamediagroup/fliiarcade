It tests the player's \"Tetris Grand Master\" capability, pitting them against extremely high-speed scenarios where they have to place pieces at the speed of thought. At later levels, pieces appear instantaneously at the bottom of the grid, forcing the player to shuffle them into the desired location in the small grace period before they \"lock\" into place.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master 2 exacerbates the difficulty even further, making it near-impossible to reach Grand Master status - in fact, only a handful of people have ever managed to achieve this feat while being recorded. Among the new requirements to reach the vaunted GM (or Grand Master) rank, the player needs to complete a sequence that occurs during the credits where the pieces are invisible after they are placed.","genre":"Puzzle","manufacturer":"Arika","year":2000,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
