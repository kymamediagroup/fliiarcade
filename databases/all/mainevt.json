A player selects two different wrestlers as their tag team, and they wrestle another tag team. If the player wins, his team moves on to another match. If he loses, he gets an immediate rematch, since the game isn't over until the player's energy falls to zero. Some of the game's most distinguishable features were an oversized \"Action\" button which would flash whenever an attack, grapple, submission or pin could be performed; and an enthusiastic announcer who introduced the wrestlers and called the action during matches.","genre":"Sports/Wrestling","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1988,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
