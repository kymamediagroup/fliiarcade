Debuting in the golden age of video arcade games, it is a time travel themed game that allowed the player's plane to freely move across open air space that can scroll indefinitely in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe Killer List of Videogames included Time Pilot in its list of top 100 arcade games of all time.\r\n\r\nThe player assumes the role of a pilot of a futuristic fighter jet, trying to rescue fellow pilots trapped in different time eras. The player must fight off hordes of enemy craft and defeat the mother ship (or \"boss\") present in every level. The background moves in the opposite direction to the player's plane, rather than the other way around; the player's plane always remains in the center.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
