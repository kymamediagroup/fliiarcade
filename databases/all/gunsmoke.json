Each outlaw wields a special weapon unique to them, such as a Winchester rifle, knives, darts or boomerangs. \r\n \r\nShooting the barrels that litter the levels reveals power-ups such as boots (for extra speed), rifles (for increased range) and bullets (for rapid fire). The game's 3 directional fire buttons (for firing left, right or ahead) can be combined (pressed Simultaneously) to create a total of 8 different firing directions.","genre":"Shooter","manufacturer":"Capcom","year":1985,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
