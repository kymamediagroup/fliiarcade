They each climb into a Mobilsuit - a jet-powered, heavily armoured combat suit - and set out on their mission.  \r\n \r\nSide Arms is a horizontally - and occasionally vertically - scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players. Each player has two fire buttons, one for shooting ahead and one for shooting behind; crucial for a game in which enemies attack from all directions. Shooting certain enemies will reveal power-ups - displayed as 'POW' icons - and shooting the icons will either change their type, or reveal a special weapon.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Capcom","year":1986,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
