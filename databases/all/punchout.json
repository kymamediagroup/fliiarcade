Players must time their punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer. \r\n \r\nThe player's opponents are each rendered as humorous cartoon-like caricatures - adding much to the game's atmosphere - and each boxer fights in a slightly different style, forcing players to adapt to their strategy. The top monitor is used for statistics while the bottom one is used to display the actual fight.","genre":"Sports/Boxing","manufacturer":"Nintendo","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
