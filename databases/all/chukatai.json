You can collect powerups and visit shops to upgrade your offensive and defensive powers. There are a number of different stages which are punctated by a mini-boss half way through and a big (literally) boss at the end.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the only games ever made which features flying noodle bowls and bears with guns.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Taito Corporation Japan","year":1988,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
