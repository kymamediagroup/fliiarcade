The object is to collect items like bottles, watches, hats, balls, and cans and bring them back to your nest. However, you must avoid a variety of animals such as rats, cats, dogs, bats and owls who are either in your way or are out to get you.\r\n\r\nThe game play is quite simple: pick up one or more objects and return them to the nest. You can throw any number of objects that you've collected to stun animals. Flying animals that have been stunned can be ridden around the screen for a short period of time. A round ends when all the desired objects have been collected in the nest. Each successive rounds adds more objects and enemies along with changing the patterns of the shortcuts.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Atari Games","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
