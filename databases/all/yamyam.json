Yam!? is a puzzle game where you have to push diamonds into trapdoors to complete each stage shown on a single screen within a time limit. You play the role of a bear type creature and you must move around the screen made up of blocks as walls that cannot be pushed. As well as the diamonds there are also other items that can be pushed like peppers and skulls and you can push multiple items at once either one square or as far as they will go.
