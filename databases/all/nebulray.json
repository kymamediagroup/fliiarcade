Nebyurasurei?) is a vertical scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1994 (but was first referred to, in the Katakana syllabic writing system of the Japanese language, in the ending for Tinkle Pit in 1993); it runs on the company's NB-1 hardware, and the players assume control of two spaceships called the \"Fighting Rays\" (red for Player 1, blue for Player 2), through six areas (Exeo, Evergrenes, Lost Marinarc, Sandvurn, Stream Drive, and Master Fortress), along with an \"extra\" one called the \"Challenging Area\" (which is the same as the first one, but the players will only have one life to get through it, for their remaining lives will have been added to their scores, after defeating the sixth area's boss). If one player is playing the game alone, another one cannot join him or her on this area, and if either player dies on it, they will not be able to continue - also, if one player was playing alone and enters his or her initials on the game's high score table after losing his or her last life and not inserting another coin to continue in time, dying on the Challenging Area, or clearing the Challenging Area, the other player's score will always be given as 7650 (Namco's goroawase number, even though, unlike in Toy Pop, Cosmo Gang: The Video, and Lucky & Wild, both scores are not combined).","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Namco","year":1994,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
