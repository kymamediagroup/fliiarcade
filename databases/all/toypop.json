The game was ported to the PlayStation in 1995 as part of Namco Museum Vol. 1 and was later released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2009 for Japan only.\r\n\r\nThe players control two dolls, Pino and Acha, and must collect four golden hearts to open an exit door, which will complete the stage (referred in this game as \"boxes\"). Pino and Acha's standared weapon are small white pellets, but these can be upgraded into more powerful weapons by shooting certain gift boxes scattered in the stage. These weapons can be used to defeat the various enemies that appear in each stage, although some enemies can only be killed with a certain weapon.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the player will need to fight the evil wizard Mahou on the seventh, fifteenth, twenty-third and thirtieth rounds of the game, while the player must fight the game's main antagonist, Majyo, on the forty-fourth floor. Additionally, the eighth, sixteenth, twenty-fourth, thirty-second and fortieth floors are bonus rounds where Pino and Acha must collect a certain number of falling apples before the timer runs out.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Namco","year":1986,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
