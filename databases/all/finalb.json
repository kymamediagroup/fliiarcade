The name would remain the same for all ported platforms, except for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis versions, which Sega released outside of Japan as James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing featuring Buster Douglas himself in 1990 immediately after his victory over Mike Tyson.\r\n\r\nThe game is essentially a side scrolling boxing game where the player moves left and right to control a screen sized boxer. When the timing is right, the player can unleash a final blow punch which can sometimes KO the opponent in a single strike. The home versions contained a spectator mode where the player can watch their favorite boxers compete.","genre":"Sports/Boxing","manufacturer":"Taito Corporation Japan","year":1988,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
