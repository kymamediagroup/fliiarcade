The game contains a number of single screen rooms where the objective is to shoot and destroy all the stationary objects called hoppers. Doors at the top and bottom of the screen will then open allowing the player to move on to the next level. In addition to the hoppers, each room has its own kind of nasties that attack and attempt to kill the player. It's also necessary to pay attention to the left and right walls which will start moving towards the centre and ultimately crush the player if the level is not completed fast enough. In addition to the regular fire, it is possible to use smart bombs which kill the nasties and stop the walls. Smart bombs can be collected in bonus rooms which appear between the regular levels.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Stern Electronics","year":1982,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
