Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal Street Fighter II, such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against.  \r\n \r\nMortal Kombat characters list: \r\nJOHNNY CAGE \r\nKANO \r\nRAIDEN \r\nLIU KANG \r\nSCORPION \r\nSUB-ZERO \r\nSONYA BLADE \r\n \r\nBattles are fought over the best of three rounds. At the end of a battle, a voice instructs the winner to 'Finish Him/Her!' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"Midway","year":1992,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Life Like Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
