The player once again assumes the role of a green-haired boxer who must fight his way up through five boxers to earn the title of 'Champ'.  \r\n \r\nAs with the original game, the player's boxer is viewed from behind with his torso rendered with wire-frame graphics (allowing the player's opponent to be easily seen). Punches, dodges and blocks must all be well-timed in order to defeat the opponent.  \r\n \r\nBoth the player and the opponent have stamina meters displayed at the top of the screen. These decrease when either boxer takes a punch and boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out completely. Faster knockdowns will cause the fallen boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch.  \r\n \r\nThanks to the refined roster of new and hugely distinctive enemy fighters, Super Punch-Out!! is considered to be an improvement over the first game.","genre":"Sports/Boxing","manufacturer":"Nintendo","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
