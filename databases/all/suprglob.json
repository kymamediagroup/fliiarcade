An assortment of crafty animals relentlessly pursue the Glob and fight him for control of the elevators. Kill them by sticking to the ceiling and dropping on them or just avoid them and munch a dozen different snacks to clear the 24 unique levels.\r\n\r\nThis game is nearly identical to the later release Beastie Feastie. Cardinal Amusement Products, who produced Beastie Feastie, was a division of EPOS Corporation.\r\nThis game was cloned as The Glob and Beastie Feastie.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Epos Corporation","year":1983,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
