General Ahkboob, himself an obvious parody of Sadam Hussein, has set his vast army of infantry, tanks and BioGenetic Mutants onto the world. \r\n \r\n1 or 2 players must fight through the enemy-packed levels, rescuing reporters and civilians as they go. Total Carnage retains the dual-joystick control of its predecessor, but introduced new weapons, enemies and large, scrolling levels to the original game-play. \r\n \r\nAs with \"Smash TV\", Total Carnage features the infamous 'Pleasuredome'; accessible only if players manage to collect the 220 keys that are hidden throughout the game's levels. Total Carnage has a much higher difficulty level than that of \"Smash TV\".","genre":"Shooter","manufacturer":"Midway","year":1992,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
