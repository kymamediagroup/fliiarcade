There are four stages in the game.\r\n\r\nEnemy ships come at you in scrolling waves. Growing bird-like ships swoop down at the player's ship as more enemy ships spring forth from the mothership. During the final wave, the player must navigate around parked ships to hit landing pad right on.\r\n\r\nThe Centuri marquee incorrectly spells the game as Pleiades but the software ROMs and main screen spell the game as Pleiads.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Tehkan","year":1981,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
