In Acrobatic Dog-Fight the playing field was limited with a ceiling and ground as well as an ultimate destination to navigate to. Acrobatic Dog-Fight also added two buttons, a secondary weapon and an eject button. Eject could be used at any time and made it possible to hijack enemy planes and continue flying them. If the pilot failed to hijack an enemy plane he would parachute to the ground where a standard plane waited nearby.","genre":"Shooter","manufacturer":"Technos Japan","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
