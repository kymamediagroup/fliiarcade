There are 8 stages in total with a battle against an end boss (or as the game calls them \"area guardian\") at the end of each stage. Enemies include standard planes, helicopters and tanks as well as more futuristic looking vehicles and space craft.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each stage a text \"Battle is begun. Good luck\" or \"Stage 2\" etc. appears. Players can actually shoot and destroy these letters for bonus points. Another notable feature is a non-English accented voice that will randomly blurt out phrases like \"yeah man, let's move on\", \"get out of my sight\" or \"yeehaw\" during the game.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"NMK","year":1993,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"e6ead349"}
