Fight non-stop waves of enemies. Your shield will stop energy blasts but not collisions\r\n\r\nThe player controls Vastar, a fighting flying robot that can shoot enemies with laser beams. Vastar is destroyed by enemy contact or strike but it is provided with a shield that must be activated to prevent attacks. When the shield's energy runs out, Vastar turns itself in an airship that still can shoot laser beams but it's defenseless against strikes. As the player reaches Vastar's base (as well if the player loses a life and restarts with another one), the shield's power is fully charged again and Vastar returns to its default form.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Orca (Sesame Japan license)","year":1983,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"b5297a3b"}
