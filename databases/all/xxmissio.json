The music is not bad, the sound effects are roots. \r\nThe gameplay is correct, the game is initially boring (the first level is very slow) to get stronger afterwards, the enemies having quite unpredictable displacements, way \"flight of drunken gnats\". \r\nNot really innovation compared to the norm but a correct realization, to reserve for fans of the old school genre.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"UPL","year":1986,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
