You can also fight side by side with a friend (who controls the pirate you didn't choose).\r\n\r\nFighting works like fencing, with a few different moves to use, including parrying. The levels scroll through with a boss at the end of each. You gain money by vanquishing foes and digging for treasure where X marks the spot.","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Atari Games","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Life Like Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
