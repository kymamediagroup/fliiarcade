It features 73 teams countries. Each team enters a \"Regional Qualifying Round Final\" where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player wins the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For Example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of Super Sidekicks 3. However, animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, Kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (Teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers). It's slogan is \"We got the kick\".\r\n\r\nUnlike its arcade counter-part, the Neo Geo version tries to be more of a soccer simulation game. Differences include the Neo Geo version more slowed down, and more realism added in shooting, passing, etc.","genre":"Sports/Soccer","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1998,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
