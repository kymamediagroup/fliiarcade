Like in the first game, the action takes place in alternate Japan (science fantasy + Sengoku period), and Oda Nobunaga is the main enemy. The player can select one from four characters: Takeda Nobukatsu, Momochi Sandayu, Seiryubo and Akechi Mitsuhide (there's also one hidden character, Saika Magoichi). \r\n \r\nGame's danmaku style is simple - fly forward, shoot enemies, collect points and weapon's upgrade, dodge myriad bullets and defeat giant bosses. Vasara 2 has one unique feature, direct contact with the enemy is not deadly - the player is only slightly repelled.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Visco","year":2001,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"11cd7098"}
