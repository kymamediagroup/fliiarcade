A once prosperous planet in an unnamed solar system was destroyed in a terrible war. The few survivors have decided to fight on and avenge their planets destruction putting their fate in your fighter Vimana (that is apparently also a saint). The name Vimana refers to a flying chariot or temple in the Hindu religion.\r\n\r\nYou fight a variety of space crafts, static guns and bosses. While playing destroyed enemies drop power-ups. These include: a weapons power-up (max five times), plus one (limited) circle bomb, plus one up and a bonus points power up. Holding the fire button down for a while and then releasing it will create a spread shot. You can play solo or with a friend.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Toaplan","year":1991,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
