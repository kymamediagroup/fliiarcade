It was licensed to Centuri who released it in arcades as Eagle. \r\n\r\nMoon Cresta is a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up. A moving starfield gives the impression of vertical scrolling, but the game is a fixed shooter in the vein of Namco's Galaxian. The action involves the player moving their ship along the base of the screen, while wave after wave of aliens come towards it. The yellow aliens split when shot, while the magenta ones are the toughest of all. Once the coast is clear, the player must attempt to manually dock their ship in a limited amount of time. Docking successfully will earn the player bonus points.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Nichibutsu","year":1980,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
