Also like Toaplan's other games, there were various differences between the Japanese version and other versions, including a checkpoint system and higher difficulty for the former. Unusually, the game contains no flying enemies; thus, a complete lack of physical obstructions and a stronger focus on the numbers and speed of ground forces.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Taito Corporation Japan","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"ce155ae0"}
