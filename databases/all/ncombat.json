The game is long and rather hard. You fight through many stages on your way to a castle. Every stage has end boss. Along the way you pick up weapons, such as clubs and axes from fallen enemies. You also pick up ninja scrolls that replenish your health bar or give you special attacks (like a fire-dragon that flies around the screen killing all enemies).\r\n\r\nThis is a side-scrolling chop socky beat-em-up.\r\n\r\nThe game is very much like SNK-Alpha Denshi's earlier regular JAMMA release, Gang Wars. A lot of the graphics and sound effects seemed to carry directly over.","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Alpha Denshi Co.","year":1990,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":""}
