The game also uses the \"tentacle mechanics\" from X Multiply. The player pilots a ship called the Flintlock and must save a blue haired princess named Irene. He flies to the right shooting at enemies in his way. The ship can grab an enemy and use it as a weapon. There is also a detachable orb called Flint available, which behaves similar to R-Type's \"Force Device\" or Gradius' \"Option\".\r\n\r\nThis game is known in Asia, Europe and Japan as \"Xexex\" and Orius during initial release in North America.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Konami","year":1991,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
