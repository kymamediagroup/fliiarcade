This is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up with the usual assortment of power-ups.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty increases as you move from jungle to the sea, to the arctic, to the skies over Hamburg. One stunning visual effect is the seven-layer parallax scrolling. The explosions and splashes into the sea are nicely rendered too.\r\n\r\nEach time that you play you will face opponents throughout the level and then defeat the main boss at the end, usually a large vehicle like a giant bomber, a submarine, or a giant tank. You can pick up special weapons as well as extra lives and mega-bombs.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"UPL","year":1990,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"cfdbb86c"}
