Enemies are able to attack the player with bombs, making him unable to jump, move and shoot for a short time.The player can also become defenseless getting hit by incoming rocks from vulcans. A life is lost when enemies touch the player and take away the robot's lower half, which can be avoided by jumping over them without touching them.\r\n\r\nThe game has three stages. In the first two, each time the robot is damaged by rocks and bombs, a friendly, short, old man appears to help fix it.\r\n\r\nAt the last part of the third one, the player faces off the game's boss: a grotesque giant monster with a ball-shaped body and an enormous mouth with pointed teeth.The goal is to shoot and destroy all of its teeth before it can reaches the player's position, otherwise the monster will devour the robot. If the player manages to win the boss, he is returned to the first stage.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Tecfri","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
