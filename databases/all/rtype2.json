This is a supporting weapon that can be equipped instead of missiles. \r\n \r\nIn addition to the new weapons, R-type II's Beam Weapon has received an upgrade. As with the first game, holding down the fire button makes a power gauge fill up, releases the button then unleashes a powerful plasma shot. For the sequel, however, continuing to hold down the button causes the gauge to charge up further. This 'double-charged' gauge flashes blue and red and releases an even more powerful plasma burst.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Irem","year":1989,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
