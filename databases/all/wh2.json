Now Dr. Brown is prepared to hold the tournament once again, not only having to invite the eight original fighters back for a second round, but also having to bring forth six new fighters as well, each and every one of them seeking to prove themselves in being the strongest fighter of history. Dr. Brown hopes that this time around, a definite winner will truly come out of the World Heroes tournament and emerge as the strongest fighter of history, but will Geegus interfere in the tournament just like last time and if so, will he be the only threat that the fighters will have to contend with in due time?","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"ADK","year":1993,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Animated Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
