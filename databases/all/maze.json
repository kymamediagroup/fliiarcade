The maze is viewed from above and the players start out on each side of the labyrinth. The objective is then simple: Each player has to make it through the maze to the starting position of the opponent before he does the same in the opposite direction. Before starting out the player has a few second to study the maze before it starts. When not having a human opponent around it's also possible to play against an AI. When playing against the AI the game goes on until the player has lost three games. For each new maze the AI speed increases. In a two player game there's a time limit and the player with most wins when it runs out is the winner. The layout of the maze is randomly generated before a game and according to the manufacturer there are more than a million different patterns.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Midway","year":1976,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
