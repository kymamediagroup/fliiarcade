A damage system allows arms to be hacked off, but fighters can keep going with only legs and the head. A special feature allows the characters to perform a decapitation manoeuver called a 'death move' (similar to Barbarian), at any time during a round, instantly killing an opponent, and subsequently ending the round. The game features cartoon-like over-the-top blood and gore violence.\r\n\r\nThere are eight selectable characters, and each one has unique weapons and attributes pertaining to the period in time they are from, e.g. Thugg is a caveman with a stone axe from 20,000 BC, Musashi is a samurai from Feudal Japan 1496, Orion is an intergalactic bounty hunter with an electro-sword from 2885 etc.\r\n\r\nIn the single player game, if you manage to defeat all standard opponents, you can face off against Death himself.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"Strata/Incredible Technologies","year":1992,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Animated Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
