The levels are an inventive mix of standard platform action and 3-D scrolling levels; the latter usually having the player driving a jeep and repelling the enemy attacks. The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player's only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a 'rope', to enable the player to reach distant platforms.","genre":"Beat-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Data East Corporation","year":1990,"rating":"AAMA - Yellow (Animated Violence Mild)","mature":false,"crc":"278f674f"}
