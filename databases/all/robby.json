It is one of the few games made available to legally download on the official website of MAME, a video game emulator.\r\n\r\nIt's kinda a cross between Dig Dug and Pac-Man. You are a round yellow man and you have to go collect your buddies down under the ground. You can't dig where you want instead you have mazes that are visable and invisable to travel through. You must avoid the bad guys that get faster and faster on each level. The buddies that you collect follow you around and each level has more of them for you to collect. Eventually you are traveling with alot of them behind you making you an easier target to attack.","genre":"Maze","manufacturer":"Bally Midway","year":1981,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
