It was also licensed to Sega/Gremlin as well.\r\n\r\nShoot the birds as they attack, dodge missiles and if it gets too much press the warp button to get out of trouble.\r\n\r\nIn Space Firebird, your ship has wandered into an asteroid field full of creatures called Space Firebirds. They are not friendly, and they immediately attack. There are three kinds of Space Firebird: Gulls take one hit to destroy, Eagles two, and the Mighty Emperors require four. They fire back, their shots sometimes exploding in all directions. They also move around in looping formations, potentially hitting you and making them harder to shoot.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Nintendo","year":1980,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
