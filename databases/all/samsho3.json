The more light-hearted characters (Earthquake, Cham Cham, and Gen-an to name a few) from the previous games have been excised, and even the kabuki master, Kyoshiro Senryo, received a redesign, transforming him from a flamboyant stage performer into a grim-faced, muscular man. All of the characters have been completely redrawn. The animation is very smooth for all characters, another departure from the graphical style of the second game.","genre":"Fighter","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1995,"rating":"AAMA - Red (Animated Violence Strong)","mature":false,"crc":""}
