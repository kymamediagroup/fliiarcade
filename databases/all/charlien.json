The player can also cloak himself so that he becomes invisible for enemies and can evade attacks. Melee attacks are also possible.\r\n\r\nEach of the stages has a different theme and a boss with a bounty at the end. The settings for the stage are the wild west, army, dilapidated industrial zone, football stadium and a mad scientists lab. Enemies attack the player directly or shoot projectiles at them. Weapon power-ups can be collected from defeated enemies and sometimes fire walls have to be circumvented. The game can be played solo or with a friend.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"Mitchell","year":1995,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
