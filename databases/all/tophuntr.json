Both Roddy and Cathy have retractable arms which can be used to grab enemies or other gameplay elements. They can then be thrown at others to destroy them. Both players and enemies can interact with the scenery. For example, walls can be pushed over enemies to kill them, and switches can be flipped to reveal special bonuses. Throughout each location, you can pull on rings that will reveal special bonuses such as extra time. There are two different planes which the players can change between by pressing a button.","genre":"Platform","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1994,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
