Leap gaps in the road for bonuses, get power-ups and ram other cars and shoot everything. The music is really horrible, but the graphics are passable, although some of the parallax background scrolling looks nice. Not particularly memorable as a classic. Very typical of SNK.","genre":"Shooter","manufacturer":"SNK","year":1984,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":""}
