The first, and primary attack involves rapidly pressing the first button which will fire the normal bullets. Each character also has a melee attack that can be used by holding the button down. The melee attack will not only damage an enemy, but will also deflect any bullets in the way.\r\n\r\nThe second button is used to deploy a bomb which will clear the screen of small enemies and do damage to the larger ones.\r\n\r\nThe Full Vasara Meter\r\nThe Full Vasara Meter\r\nThe third method of attack uses a meter called the \"Vasara\" meter. Once the Vasara meter is full it can be used by holding down the primary attack button for a small amount of time and them released. The Vasara attack is a larger version of the melee attack which does large amounts of damage. The Vasara meter can be replenished by collecting various items dropped by the enemies such as red jewels.","genre":"Shoot-'Em-Up","manufacturer":"Visco","year":2000,"rating":"AAMA - Green (Suitable For All Ages)","mature":false,"crc":"5f303698"}
